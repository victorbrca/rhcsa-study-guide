# RHCSA Community Study Guide

This repo serves as a community study guide for anyone that wants to study for the RHCSA exam. The idea is that anyone preparing for the exam can use the information here, as well as contribute (add, update, correct) to make it better. The aim is to have a free and Open Source study guide that is always up to date and with the best content.

Please adhere to the guidelines, and most importantly, [Red Hat's NDA](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/red-hat-training-policies#terms).

**Current Version:** RHCSA v9 + v8 (_with container objectives_). Objectives which do not overlap are prefixed with RHCSA9 and RHCSA8 respectively.

## How to use

The content is available in two places: the website (front end) [https://rhcsa-study-guide.org](https://rhcsa-study-guide.org), and the repo (source files) [https://github.com/victorbrca/rhcsa-study-guide](https://github.com/victorbrca/rhcsa-study-guide) The website displays markdown files as html.
