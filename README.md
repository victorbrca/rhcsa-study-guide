# RHCSA Community Study Guide

This repo serves as a community study guide for anyone that wants to study for the RHCSA exam. The idea is that anyone preparing for the exam can use the information here, as well as contribute (add, update, correct) to make it better. The aim is to have a free and Open Source study guide that is always up to date and with the best content.

Please adhere to the guidelines, and most importantly, Red Hat's NDA.

**Current Version:** RHCSA v8 _(with container objectives)_

## How to use

As a study guide it makes more sense to digest the content via your web browser. You can access it at the [Objectives](markdown/Objectives.md) page.

If you want to edit the content, start by reviewing the [rules](markdown/Rules.md). After you can choose to edit the contents by following the proper procedure for contributing changes to a Git Hub repository (if you are not familiar with the Git Hub process you can find simple instructions [here](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html)), or by creating a Git Hub [issue](https://github.com/victorbrca/rhcsa-study-guide/issues/new/choose).
